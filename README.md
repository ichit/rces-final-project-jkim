## Seasonality in Salinity, Temperature, and Overturning of the North Atlantic

**Goal:** to investigate monthly changes in salinity and temperature of the North Atlantic (40N to ~70N), a region that includes the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland Ridge, the Norwegian/Greenland Sea, the Labrador Sea, and if data is available, the Baffin Bay. If possible, the influence the changes in salinity and temperature have on the overturning in the North Atlantic will be investigated. 

**Data used:** “Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean” ([ECCO](https://ecco.jpl.nasa.gov)) (_version 4_)

**The planned analysis:** 

1. Generate maps that show surface salinity changes averaged monthly.
2. Generate maps that show surface temperature changes averaged monthly.
3. Compute the volumetric transport or streamfuction across a section in the North Atlantic, and generate figures that show monthly changes in the overturning in the North Atlantic.
4. If time allows, analyze the correlation between overturning changes and sea surface temperature/salinity changes.
